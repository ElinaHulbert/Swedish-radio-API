# Swedish Radio API App made with Vanilla JS

##### :clock1130: Date:

January 2022

##### :muscle: What was my motivation?

This project is a first part of a module at Hyper Island where we were supposed to slowly move from Vanilla JS to React and compare them by creating the same app in both ways. 

##### :books: What did I learn?

This was the most difficult one for me because I wasn't really ready for React but needed to focus on both the syntaxis of React and improving Vanilla JS skills. I had to leave the project for a while to be able to focus on it later on but my JS understanding grew tremendously after it. 

##### :flashlight: How to use the project?
